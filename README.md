### 2. Speed Detector

Takes the speed of a car and:

- Prints `"Ok"` if speed ≤ 70
- Assigns 1 demerit point for every 5 km/s above 70
- Suspends license if points > 12

### 3. Net Salary Calculator (2025)

Calculates **Net Salary** by factoring in:

- **PAYE (Tax)** — based on KRA 2025 tax bands
- **SHIF** — 2.75% of gross salary
- **NSSF** — Tier I & II contributions
- **Housing Levy** — 1.5% of gross salary

Outputs: gross salary, deductions, and net salary.
